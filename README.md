# book-list-server
client-side app for the code 301 book list

**Author**: Scott & Collin
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We built the client-side code to fetch and display book data from the server. 

## Getting Started
The user must create a database for the server to access, and then use this data to create objects whose properties are eventually appended to the DOM.

## Architecture
we are using jQuery, Node.js dependencies such as express, cors, pg, and also psql for database management, and nodemon/live-server for testing. Heroku for deployment.
